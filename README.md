### Machine Learning 3

We studied methods of reinforce learning, e.g. DQN, SARSA, TD, Monte Carlo Policy Evaluation, e.t.c., in the spring semester of 2019. In a repository 'Machine Learning 3', there are codes for homeworks of the class and I used NumPy and TensorFlow.

### Algorithms

We learned some algorithms, e.g. greedy, divide and conquer, e.t.c. , and solved some problems using the algorithms in the spring semester of 2020. The main textbook of the course was 'Introduction to the Design & Analysis of Algorithms'written by Anany Levitin. In a repository 'Algorithms', there are codes for homework of the class. Almost all of them are done with C.

### Numerical Analysis

We studied numerical methods for solving algebraic and differential equations, interpolation, integration, and optimization. In a repository 'Numerical Analysis', there are codes for homework of the class. They are the implementation of algorithms learned in the class with MATLAB.
